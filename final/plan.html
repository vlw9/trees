  <h1>Plan</h1>
  <p>Largely because I’m still not 100% comfortable with Vue (an understatement),
    I’m hoping to use Vue on this project to continue learning. The most important feature would be
    the “upload” feature for both writers and artists. I would want to separate
    the uploads under two tabs, “art” and “writing,” but I would want both to
    be visible to all users no matter which they might fall under.</p>
  &ensp;
  <p>Having users was something I really struggled with in trello, so in this
    project I intend to fix that; big thing being that the website would recognize
    user authority over their work. In other words, only works that you uploaded
    are interactive to you; you can’t go deleting or editing someone else’s thing
    (unless perhaps they set their permissions so that others can.
    Something else to consider). Users should be able to access their profile at
    the top right of the page, and there they should have a button somewhere
    along the lines of "Edit Your Information". Their bio would be public to all.</p>
  &ensp;
  <p>A third tab would be user pins: any works would show up here if user clicked
    on "Pin this work" while browsing the work itself. There are many reasons one
    would do this, such as to come back to something for later viewing pleasure or
    to save for another time, etc. </p>
  &ensp;
  <p>If there ever became too many uploads, it would probably be
    convenient to have a sort or even search function.</p>
    &ensp;
  <p>In terms of “pre-populating,” I don’t think that will be a problem—I can
    very easily upload my own works on there, but I can also share a link to
    the work-in-progress site among my groups and have them test it out so that there
    will be varied data from different people and styles on the site.
 </p>
 <p>As an example, here is a very rough sketch of what the site could look like made using microsoft paint
   for a user named 61minutes. Note that both the short dialogue and the paintings
   used are licensed under a creative commons license, which is available at the
   bottom of this page.</p>

 <p>Clicking on the work will lead to an expanded view.</p>

 <p>Here's a view of the writing tab:</p>
 <img src="writing_tab.png" width=80% alt="writing tab">
 <p>Clicking on the writing piece will bring the user to the work itself, where
    they can read and comment as well as view other users' comments. Pin this work
    is intentionally included at both the top and bottom of the screen so that users
    can 1. pin as a way to return to this work (read later), or 2. pin to read again.</p>
