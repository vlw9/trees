  <h1>Topic</h1>
  <p>I want to create a site where writers and artists can engage. Writers can
     upload short (or long) stories to the site and their fellow writers can
     browse the works and leave comments/thoughts/suggestions. Readers also have
     the opportunity to keep a working list of their favorite stories so they can
     return to them at a later date. On the flip side, artists (who also have access
     to the writing tools) do the same thing; they upload their works to an audience
     of primarily other artists and writers, whereupon they can receive feedback from
     their peers. They can also "pin" their favorite pieces, or simply pieces that
     they would like to observe again at a later date.</p>
     &ensp;
  <p>This idea interests me because I am an active member in both the writing and the
     painting circles, and we currently only post on separate Facebook groups. It
     would be very cool to have our own site to work with; even cooler if my two societies
     could unite and learn from each other. </p>
     &ensp;
  <p>Possible data sources - probably mostly data loaded in by the users? </p>
